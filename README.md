## Project: Cookie Stand Admin Version 3

### Project Description

Cookie stand admin app created using Next.js and styled using Tailwind CSS. The app features a React front-end and Django CRUD back-end. On the front-end, the user uses a login form. This connects to the API which authenticates the user using token authentication. Once logged in, the user can add new cookie stand location information. The user can also delete any cookie stands they added.
